# Fourier Series in Python

This is a uni proyect that I wanted to upload because my github looks very empty jajajsja

Basically this code draws a function with matplotlib, in the interval (-Ï€/2, Ï€/2)
It's done by taken as a parameter a function, and the number of fourier series coeficients

So it's all, if you wanna try it, i recommend start trying low numbers as coeficients, and idk just enjoy it ðŸ˜œ
